How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    利用Git管理代码的不同版本

Compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.

git diff will do this. It takes two arguments - the two commit ids to compare. 


Make a copy of an entire Git repository, including the history, onto your own computer.

git clone will do this. It takes one argument - the url of the repository to copy. 


Temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit.

git checkout will do this. It takes one argument - the commit ID to restore. 


Show the commits made in this repository, starting with the most recent.

git log will do this. It doesn't take any arguments.



初始化版本库时会发生什么情况？为什么你需要这样做？

git init create a new repository
git status display the status of a repository
git add <file> add a file into the staging area(暂存区)
git rm --cached <file> remove a file from the staging area, but it is still in the working directory.
git reset remove all files from the staging area

git commit -m "Commit message" commit all changes to the repostiory
